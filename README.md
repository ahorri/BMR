<h2>Advantages of BMR </h2>
1- Creation of two new models for Optimal schedule
2- The balance of workloads by the distance from the bisector of the first quadrant in the objective function
3- Optimizing the migration time by defining the parameter and control coefficient in the objective function
4- The use of an 18-layer neural network has not been used in previously reviewed works in this field.
5- Categorizing data centers at the level of servers and hosts to create greater ease and flexibility
6- The definition of various user accounts for receiving network services was introduced according to cost, energy consumption, and service quality.
7- The implementation in the natural environment is also described in a knowledge-based product with a technical map
<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
To run the MBR schedule, install required packages using
run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell
To run the code with the required scheduler, modify the main.py to one of the several options.
