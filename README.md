# BMR
<p>(Bisectore Migration ResponseTime)</p>
<p>Resources at the network edge are limited due to cost and feasibility factors. As a result, effective use of resources is necessary to accept more workloads and increase service quality. Therefore, we need scheduling solutions that are effective on unstable and dynamic environments, and more efficient than previous methods. The method of this research is to create a model called (BMR)*)  in the simulation environment that uses a neural network (Resnet). In order to increase the prediction accuracy, a hybrid solution has been used in the objective function. This model is able to adapt very quickly in unstable environments. Also, several innovations have been used so that the computing resources of data centers have high flexibility for division and distribution, as well as optimization of resource balance and migration. This is effective for reducing energy consumption and increasing workloads per unit of time. Also, the average migration time compared to similar models has been optimized to reach the maximum efficiency of the network bandwidth. The evaluations of the (BMR*)  model have obtained significant improvements in energy consumption, response time, waiting time, workloads performed per unit of time and resource balance of hosts compared to previous methods</p>

<h2>Advantages of BMR </h2>,


<p>1- Creation of two new models for Optimal schedule</p>
<p>2- The balance of workloads by the distance from the bisector of the first quadrant in the objective function.</p>
<p>3- Optimizing the migration time by defining the parameter and control coefficient in the objective function.</p>
<p>4- The use of an 18-layer neural network has not been used in previously reviewed works in this field.</p>
<p>5- Categorizing data centers at the level of servers and hosts to create greater ease and flexibility.</p>
<p>6- The definition of various user accounts for receiving network services was introduced according to cost, energy consumption, and service quality.</p>
<p>7- The implementation in the natural environment is also described in a knowledge-based product with a technical map.</p>
<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
<p>To run the MBR schedule, install required packages using</p>
<p>run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell</p>
<p>To run the code with the required scheduler, modify the main.py to one of the several options.</p>
